# VirtualCircuitBoard-Stuffs

This repository is less showing to the public and more transfering files back and forth between computers.
Feel free to explore what I have, this does require the game "Virtual Circuit Board" on steam. (link below)

I have been having some issues with github recently tho so im hoping that the files actually go into the repo like they are supposed to.
